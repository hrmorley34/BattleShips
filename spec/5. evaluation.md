# Evaluation
## Overall Summary

The game plays well as a simple battleships clone. It uses colour well to indicate what can/can't be done and what is good or bad for the user, and it is quite a modular solution (so, for example, the extension points 10 and 11 were very easy to include). The save/restore implementation works well, and was simple in code to implement. However, the code is in general a bit over-engineered and possibly more complex/spread-out than it needs to be.

## Success Criteria

1. The menu clearly shows options, including greying out the Resume option when unavailable. The instructions are well-formatted to the window size, and the options reliably do the correct things, including changing options and quitting.
2. Boat entry works correctly, both by typing coordinates or navigating with arrow keys. Rotation also works for longer boats without affecting 1-length boats. The existing boats are displayed and overlaps are clear in red, making it obvious why it fails to submit when it does.
3. The computer locations seem suitably random and are not shown to the user until they are later guessed. Ships reliably do not overlap.
4. Player/computer target trackers are displayed with a grid with labelled columns and rows and the correct items in the correct cells.
5. Position entry works correctly, and does nothing when attempting to submit an already shot position, displaying the cursor in red. It then displays where and what has been shot.
6. The computer turn seems random, and its move is shown to the user in appropriate colours.
7. Win checks kick in at the end of the game, as they should. They work properly for 1-long and longer ships.

8. The game is saved after every turn, overwriting the file.
9. The Resume successfully gets back to the state that the game was in, selecting the correct next turn. **The game could be improved by reminding the player of the state that they left the game in; it could also have a *save slots* option, or a way to name save files to not overwrite other games.**

10. The boat sizes can be changed from the menu, and then affect the boat entry menu correctly. **This could be improved by making it clearer which option is selected while placing boats, such as by showing which boats are left to be placed next.**
11. Boats are correctly marked as hit (and boat) when partially hit and sunk when fully hit.

## 3rd Party feedback

> It's fun, although the 1x1s are a pain to find, because you have to go through every cell on the screen to find them. The colours are nice and obvious to show you can do this, you can't do that etc. Good instructions on how to play. Simple and easy to understand.

## Feedback response

> 1x1s are a pain to find

This could be more of an issue of the scenario (requiring 1x1 boats by default); however, this could be remedied by adding more options for customising numbers/lengths of boats, including allowing changing the numbers/lengths of boats.

## Improvements

### Save slots

Before starting or continuing a game, the user would have to select a slot to save to (calling `Serialiser<Game>` with a different filename). Options to delete save slots from the main menu would also be useful.

### Backing out

In boat entry input and the main game, it would be handy to have a way of getting back to the main menu screen. One way this could be achieved is by throwing a special new Exception which is caught in the `Main` procedure in `Program.cs`.
