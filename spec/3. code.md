# Code

The code is broken up into files based on what it does.
* The players are in `Player/`, with console interactivity in `Player/HumanPlayer.cs` and computer random generation in `Player/ComputerPlayer.cs`
* The board is in `Board/Board.cs`
* The boat object is defined in `Boat.cs`
* File IO is in `File.cs`
* The main running of the game happens in `Game.cs`
* The menu logic is in `Menu.cs`
* The menu is executed from `Program.cs`
